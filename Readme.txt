This code will run on google colab, the google.colab library is utilized to facilitate mounting Google Drive to the Colab environment. This enables easy access to files stored on Google Drive.

We use pip, to install the required Python packages, which includes PdfReader, langchain, PyPDF2, InstructorEmbedding, sentence_transformers, and faiss, among others.

The PyPDF2 library extracts text from PDFs, enabling us to process the text data we require. Additionally, we import various components from the langchain library, such as CharacterTextSplitter, OpenAIEmbeddings, HuggingFaceInstructEmbeddings, FAISS, ChatOpenAI, ConversationBufferMemory, ConversationalRetrievalChain, RetrievalQA, HuggingFaceHub, and PromptTemplate. These components will play a significant role in processing text and enabling question-answering functionality.

Also, you will have to use your own Huggingface API token.
